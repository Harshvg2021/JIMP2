as the project manager here are the few task that ryuk and vaibhav have to do
1) add oop pillars to the classes
2) paging on functions like displaysongs , search songs etc
3) get related data from api and covert in form  of csv(to know what data to fetch check the classes)
4) if possible try to provide sopitify links to play the songs (optional)
5)
the new codebase is very easy to understand , so make sure that any change u make , we are still able to run the core_classes/main.java file
